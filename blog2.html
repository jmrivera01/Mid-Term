                <p1>I love technology and innovation so of course we need to talk about old Billy here! Bill was born in Seattle, WA on October 28,1955. I am proud to say he is one of our fellow Washingtonians! He is not only known for his amazing job with creating Microsoft, but he is also a big philanthropist supporting many noble causes via the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation which was established in 2000.

                    Bill Gates cofounded Microsoft with Paul Allen in 1975. Thanks to his savvy entrepreneurship with licensing his software to millions of computers, he became the world’s richest man. Without Windows, I don’t think that the personal computer or PC would have been so accessible and successful if it wasn’t for the user friendliness that Windows provided. I’m a big gamer and I remember playing my first video game for computers Ages of Empire on my Windows 95 PC! Now a days, thanks to Microsoft, we now have the XBOX consoles which I love to game on. Without Bill Gates, none of this would have happened!
