                <p1>Of all the inventors and scientist of all times, my all-time favorite is Nikola Tesla! This eccentric person was well known for his time to be a visionary and his outside of the box thinking lead him to come across many important discoveries in the scientific world. Tesla is known for his alternating current discovery. This led him to a gruesome battle with former boss Thomas Edison, inventor of the light bulb and DC or direct current over which system was more efficient in carrying energy over long distances. The both campaigned for each other’s work to the point that Edison killed an elephant just to show how powerful DC current was while tesla could walk across an AC field with no harm done.

                    Some say Edison won the battle, but its Tesla’s innovation that kept him going. He was a mystic and a very eccentric person. One of my favorite Tesla stories is the one associated with a project called “The Philadelphia Experiment”. According to the story, using very high energy AC fields to hide stuff from radar, the boat became invisible for a moment and then came back! Apparently when the boat reappeared, there were people stuck in the floors and wall as if they went right through. No one can confirm but it is still a pretty fun story!
