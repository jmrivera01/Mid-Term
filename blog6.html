                <p1>I am a big Apple fan so it comes with no surprise that one of my personal heroes is Steve Jobs! His whole story is just so inspiring for any entrepreneur out there. His vision and futuristic thoughts distinguished him from the rest and made him a force to be reckoned with. Jobs’ history is quite amazing. He founded several companies like Next, Inc. and Pixar. I love Pixar movies since they always have a great story and a good moral for everyone. Thanks to his vision, Jobs’ came out with the iPod, iPhone and iPads that set Apple on an amazing run as more customers embraced the products.

                    Apple became more user friendly over time and has ended in a very successful run of launching their products. I create iOS apps and the simplicity of the Swift language makes it easy to come up with an app fairly easy. It is inspiring that Apple was made in a garage and became one of the most influential companies in the world. Unfortunately, our genius was taken from us sooner than expected, but his legacy lives on forever as a self-made man and business magnate in our history books.
