                <p1>Out of all the programming languages out there, for me the best one is opened-sourced Swift from Apple, Inc. Swift is a very easy to read program that takes care of a lot of stuff in the back end that enables the developer to focus on other things. When I moved to Austin, TX back in 2014, I was doing developer support for Apple helping the developers get to whatever they were looking for be it how to implement a framework or having issues with the app on the App Store. Swift came out while I was working at Apple and it was amazing to see how by simplifying the language inspired millions of developers to create great apps immediately!

                <p1>By learn Objective-C before learning Swift so I appreciate the major changes like memory handling when creating variables. In 2019, Swift 5 came out, corrected some errors and added  some functionality like integer and the Swift package manager updates. Another thing that I love about Swift it’s frameworks! Frameworks like the HomeKit and HealthKit provide amazing functionalities that save developers countless hours of code writing. This was my bread and butter while I worked at Apple. I’m no pro but I have two or three simple apps on the App Store. Trust me I’m no genius but that can show that Swift’s simplicity makes it easy for the average Joe to create an amazing app!
