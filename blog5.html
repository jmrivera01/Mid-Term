                <p1>Who doesn’t love to go down the art gallery and just admire great works of art. I love to go and see what people are creating with their imaginations. All of these artists that we have today have to thank their predecessors is Leonardo Da Vinci! You can ask any person in the street and they will probably know who Leonardo is! Not only an amazing painter, he was also gifted knowledge that allowed him to sketch up some engineering projects that were out of his times like a flying machine. If you haven’t seen the sketches I recommend you do so because it’s pretty mind blowing for his times!

                    Leonardo is well known for one of his creations called the Mona Lisa. His techniques where extremely advanced for his time and his sense of depth on his paintings. Rumors say that supposedly the woman in the painting is a model but some say it is Da Vinci dressed in women’s clothing. I love conspiracy theories! He also created what he called a Mechanical Knight. This designs where found in a sketchbook that were discovered in the 1950s. Supposedly the robot could move through a series of pullies and cables. Look it up it’s right there! He inspires me to create and be creative when I work on my digital art pieces.
