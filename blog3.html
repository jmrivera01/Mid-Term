                <h1><span style="font-size: 30px;">Info about Elon Musk:</span></h1>
                <p1>One of my personal heroes for many reasons is my main man Elon Musk. I love thinking outside the box and this man is one of the best. From sending people to space to contributing to the automotive world with his electric cars. Who hasn’t thought about going to space! He is definitely an innovator in many ways! Musk was born on June 28, 1971 and was raised in Pretoria, South Africa. Musk became wealthy after he sold X.com which became PayPal, one of the biggest electronic wallets in the world today! 
                </p1>
                <p1>
                    Elon is definitely a visionary and he has the resume to do so! Starting with Tesla, he revolutionized the auto world with his “Self-Driven” car. I wouldn’t trust my life with the so called autopilot, but we are surely getting there. SpaceX is another one of his babies. SpaceX is Musk’s vision of space travel and commercialization of space. I mean, when you launche your car into space you know he has to be doing something right!                </p1>
