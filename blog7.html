                <h1><span style="font-size: 30px;">Some Cool IOS 15 Features:</span></h1>
                <p1>iOS 15 is an amazing version of the iOS that brought a bunch new feature. For me I think the coolest one is the ability to watch videos with your loved ones. I am all into the engaging via the web and this is the closest we can get at sharing and spending time with a relative that leaves far away using SharePlay on iOS! I think another update that was made was to use Face ID with the mask on by analyzing the unique characteristics around your eyes. Isnâ€™t that amazing?!
                    </p1>
                    <p1>  I love AR and VR technology since it is so immersive you feel like you can do anything from being a wizard to just been an explorer. Apple has been building their ARKit for a couple of years for developers to exploit. Now the latest version ARKit 5 has a really cool feature called Location Anchors in selected cities! You can place anchor your creations to the real world by using latitude, longitude and altitude. This is amazing! I have always wanted to do an app for a Virtual Tour of Seattle and when I saw this I went bananas! This is one of the many example why I love iOS and Swift development.
                </p1>
                <p1> One last cool feature in ARKit 5 is the Instant AR. The way it works is that the LIDAR scanner enables quick plane detection, allowing for the instant placement of AR objects in the real world without scanning. This saves a bunch of coding time and makes it easier to concentrate on being more creative. I love iOS and Swift and I hope one day I will be working as an iOS Developer for Apple! Until then all I can do is continue learning and applying everything that I know.
