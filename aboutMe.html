                <h1><span style="font-size: 30px;">Here is some information regarding me:</span></h1>
                <p1>Well where can we start! I was born on January 21, 1987 and raised in Ponce, Puerto Rico. I studied in a bilingual school where I learned English. I loved my school as they really helped me to succeed once I was in college. I always loved science and inventing so I was naturally drawn to the Sciences in college so I when I graduated from High School in 2005, I moved to Miami to study Chemistry at Florida International University with the aim of going to med school. I was running the chemistry labs and everything was fine Unfortunately, in 2007 my dad’s company went bankrupt and I was forced to leave the labs and get a job as a Front Desk agent in a hotel in Miami Beach and had to stop going to school so in 2009 I decided to go back to Puerto Rico and finish my degree and so I did! In 2014, I graduated from college and moved to Austin, TX where I managed to get a job with apple doing Developer Support in their campus in Austin.

                I have always been a techno sexual, but working this role made me realize that I could code too! This was very important because I decided to pursue a career in the tech world, especially iOS app designs. I taught myself how to read and write Swift which I love due to its simplicity. I moved to Renton in December 2015 since my mom moved to Washington right after I moved to Austin. Ever since then I have worked with a couple of companies like Microsoft and Booking.com. I decided to build websites for a couple of restaurants in the area like a year and a half ago and decided to go back to school last year August 2021 to pursue an AS in Computer Science. Who knows maybe I’ll go all the way to the bachelor’s degree! I hope this gave you a little insight as to who I am!
