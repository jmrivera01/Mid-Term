                    Einstein was the father of many in theories In the physics world. Thanks to E=mc2 we were able to harness the power of the atom. The Manhattan project was the culmination of Einsteinâ€™s work. Splitting the atom created such an amount of energy that was not even thought about. The atom bomb was a by-product which helped win WW2. His Relativity Theory has also been controversial since it cannot be reconciled with Quantum Mechanics. He also worked on a theory that led to the discovery of the photon!
